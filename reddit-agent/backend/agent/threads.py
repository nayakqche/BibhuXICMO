"""Find recent threads worth commenting on, and draft helpful replies.

The flow is tuned for efficiency:

  - ONE paid Apify call per request -- a single batched scrape of
    recent posts across every selected subreddit.
  - ONE batched LLM call to score every post for relevance.
  - PARALLEL LLM calls (default concurrency 4) to draft replies for
    each kept thread; finished threads stream back as they complete,
    so the user sees results faster than the worst-case wall time.

The public entry point comes in two flavours:

  - find_threads(...)            -> returns the full result list
  - find_threads_stream(...)     -> yields SSE-ready progress events

business that wants to leave *helpful, non-spammy* comments.

For each post, decide how good a fit it is for someone working in this
space to add value. Score generously when the OP is asking a question
we can clearly help with; score low when the thread is off-topic, a
meme, an announcement, or a place where comments would feel
promotional.

Reply with JSON of this exact shape:

_REPLIES_SYSTEM = """You write Reddit comments that DO NOT look like
ads. You're commenting as a real human who happens to work in this
space. Rules:

1. Lead with empathy or a concrete observation about OP's situation.
2. Give a specific, useful idea or framework even if they don't use our
   product. No fluff, no buzzwords.
3. At MOST one soft mention of our product, only if it is genuinely the
   best answer. Phrase it like "we built X to solve Y, happy to share
   what we learned" -- never a hard sell, never a link unless it would
   come across as helpful.
4. Match the subreddit tone (casual, lowercase ok, short paragraphs).
5. Each reply should be DIFFERENT in angle (e.g. one tactical tip, one
   contrarian take, one personal anecdote, one question that helps OP
   think).
6. 40-140 words each. No emoji unless the thread uses them.
7. Do NOT repeat what other commenters already said.
